## ðŸ”’ Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Secure SDLC** integrates security practices into every phase of the software development life cycle. Here's how cyber security plays a crucial role at each stage:

### 1. Requirements
- **Security Requirements Gathering**: Identify and document security requirements alongside functional requirements.

### 2. Design
- **Secure Architecture**: Design systems with security in mind, incorporating best practices and secure design principles.
- **Threat Modeling**: Assess potential threats and vulnerabilities based on user requirements and system architecture.

### 3. Implementation
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow coding standards that minimize vulnerabilities, such as input validation and error handling.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular peer reviews to catch security flaws early in the development process.

### 4. Testing
- **Security Testing**: Perform static and dynamic analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses.

### 5. Deployment
- **Secure Deployment Practices**: Implement security configurations and hardening measures before going live.
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized personnel have access to deployment environments and production systems.

### 6. Maintenance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor applications for security incidents and vulnerabilities post-deployment.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update software and infrastructure to address new security threats.

By embedding security at each phase, we can create resilient software that protects sensitive data and maintains user trust.
